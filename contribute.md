## Overview

This page explains how to contribute to *edav.info/*.

## Why Contribute?

We don't want *edav.info/* to be just another resource. Rather, we want it to be *your* resource. If there are things that trip you up or cause you frustration, chances are you're not alone. Everyone comes to this course with different backgrounds and expertise. Being able to collect all that knowledge in one place is this resource's mission and you can help move that mission forward. 

## Ways You Can Contribute

Below are different ways you can contribute to *edav.info/*. We welcome all input.

### Contribute Directly

The simplest way to contribute to *edav.info/* is to **contribute directly** by editing a chapter. At the top of every page of this resource, you will see an icon that looks like this: <i class="fas fa-edit"></i>. Clicking it will open a new tab where you can edit the markdown on [GitHub](https://github.com/jtr13/EDAV){target="_blank"} for that page and submit your change as a pull request. Essentially, you will make a copy of our repo, make your desired change, and suggest to us that we fix it. If we approve it, your fix will be rendered and published to the site.

Contributing directly works best if the change you are proposing is something small, such as:

- A typo/grammatical error
- An unclear phrasing/explanation

**How to Contribute Directly**:

1. Click the <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> icon at the top of the page you would like to edit
2. Follow the instructions from GitHub (you may need to fork the repo)
3. Propose your file change
4. That's it! We will review your proposed change and respond as soon as we can :)

In summary, fix small issues as often as you like!

If what you want to improve is a little more substantial, read on.

### Submit A New Issue

If your proposed change is more complex, consider letting us know by **submitting an issue**. Say some links are broken, or a graph example is inaccurate or misleading. What to do? Submit an issue, of course! Issues are tasks you can post to a GitHub repo that people can then take on and fix. They can be small ("this link is broken" / "add this resource") or complex ("I would love to have a chapter on..." / "reformat this code chunk in this way"). Once posted, issues can be taken on by anyone.

You do *not* have to know how to code up your issue; we appreciate any feedback you have and will take it all into consideration.

**How to Submit Issues**:

1. Go to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jtr13/EDAV){target="_blank"} and click on the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/jtr13/EDAV/issues){target="_blank"}
2. Click on "[New Issue](https://github.com/jtr13/EDAV/issues/new){target="_blank"}"
3. Propose your Issue and click "Submit new issue"
4. That's it! We appreciate your input and will take your issue into account in improving *edav.info/* :)

**Notes about submitting issues**:

- Make sure your changes are not already an open issue (so as not to have redundant issues)
- Please thoroughly explain your proposed change when posting a new issue
- For more info, please considering reading the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/){target="_blank"} on how to contribute.

### Solve an Open Issue

If you see an open issue that you think you can solve, by all means go for it! Simply fork our repo, add to the code base, and submit your work as a pull request. We appreciate any input you may have. For more info, please consider reading the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/){target="_blank"} on how to contribute.
